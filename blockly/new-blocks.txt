How to make new blocks:

Documentation on defining:
    https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/DefiningBlocks

Documentation on generating code:
    https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/GeneratingCode

BrickPi Block Definitions/Generators:
    /blockytalky/blockly/static/generators/python/brickpi.js
    
    Definitions at the top of the file, generators at the bottom 
    below the "//DEFINE GENERATORS" comment

Blockly Webpage:
    /blockytalky/blockly/static/apps/code/en2.html

Page Templates:
     /blockytalky/blockly/static/apps/code/template.soy
     /blockytalky/blockly/static/apps/code/template2.soy

Procedure:
    1. Add new definition/generator to `blockly/static/generators/python/brickpi.js`
    2. Add new block to `blockly/static/apps/code/template.soy`, compile with
command copied from top of the file
    3. Add new block to `blockly/static/apps/code/template2.soy, compile with
command copied from top of the file
    4. Compile the project by running `python blockly/static/build.py`
**This must be done every time you change the generator file**
    NOTE: YOU MUST DO BOTH, AND ACTUALLY USE THE RIGHT COMMAND FOR EACH FILE
    NOTE: for now put things under the BrickPi category
